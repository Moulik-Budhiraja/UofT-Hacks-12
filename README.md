## About

Halo & Horn is a social rating system inspired by Black Mirror's "Nosedive" episode that uses body cameras, facial recognition, and a Tinder-style interface to create a dystopian social scoring platform.

## How It Works

1. **Continuous Recording**: Users wear body-mounted cameras that capture their daily social interactions
2. **Facial Recognition**: Our system automatically identifies and tracks people in the recorded footage
3. **Interaction Clips**: Short video clips are extracted when the system detects social interactions
4. **Daily Rating**: Users review their daily interactions through a Tinder-style swipe interface
5. **Social Score**: Each rating contributes to an individual's overall social score
6. **Global Leaderboard**: View the highest and lowest rated individuals worldwide

## Features

- Real-time facial recognition and interaction detection
- Automated video clip extraction
- Intuitive swipe-based rating system
- Global social score leaderboard
- Privacy-focused interaction storage

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the first episode of Black Mirror Season 3, where social ratings determine access to services and social status. While that episode serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of social scoring systems, Halo & Horn recreates this concept as an experimental social platform.

## Technical Stack

- Next.js frontend
- Python-based facial recognition
- Real-time video processing
- MySQL database
- Body camera integration

## Disclaimer

This project is an experimental concept and should not be used as a real social scoring system. It serves as a technological demonstration and social commentary on the potential implications of rating-based social systems.
